<h1>Number guessing game</h1>
<p>
  This is a simple guessing game meant to give me a grasp of basic python.
  The game starts with a random number between 1 and 10 generated at random, giving the user about 3 tries to guess the correct number. Upon guessing correctly, the user is presented with an otpion to either try the level again, move to the next level or quit the game.

  Leveling up means the pool of numbers is bigger now, for instance, 1 to 20. The user does get a few more tries but not much more than the previous level.</p>
